## KEY   FINDINGS--->
1. OVERALL GROWTH 
TOTAL NET FOLLOWER GROWTH = +161,588 ACROSS PLATFORM. 
AVERAGE ENGAGEMENT RATE =6.7%, WHICH IS HEALTHY FOR INDUSTRY.
 
2. PLATFORM  PERFORMANCE 
INSTAGRAM : STRONG REACH , BUT ROI (4.93 FOLLOWERS PER $100) SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN OTHERS.
TWITTER :  BALANCED PERFORMANCE , ROI = 4.99. 
YOUTUBE:  BEST ROI (5.16 FOLLOWER PER $100) -MOST EFFICIENT IN CONVERTING AD SPEND INTO FOLLOWERS .

3. AD. SPENDS

4.CAMPIAGN  INSIGHTS
CHILLVIBES & INDIEWAVE SHOW HIGH ENGAGEMENT  UPLIFT. 
WRAPPED2024 HAD BIG BUDGETS BUT ENGAGEMENT EFFICIENCY (PER  ₹SPENT) WAS LOWER. 
CLICKS THROUGH ARE STRONG FOR CAMPAIGNS TIED TO DISCOVER WEEKLY    AND   SPOTIFY WRAPPED HASHTAGS. 

## RECOMMENDATIONS---->

1.FOCUS AD SPENDS. ON YOUTUBE 
HIGHEST ROI -->ALLOCATE A BIGGER SHARE OF THE NEXT CAMPAIGN 'S BUDGETS HERE. 

2.OPTIMIZE INSTAGRAM STRATEGY
HIGH SPEND BUT LOWER ROI. 
RECOMMENDATION: SHIFT TOWARDS ORGANIC CONTENT( REELS, STORIES)+INFLUENCER TIE -UPS INSTEAD OF HEAVY ADS. 

3. DOUBLE DOWN ON PROVEN HASHTAGS 
CAMPAIGNS USING #DISCOVER WEEKLY AND #SPOTIFYWRAPPED PERFORM STRONGLY. 
KEEP THESE AS CORE HASHTAGS ACROSS PLATFORMS. 

4. CAMPAIGN STRATEGY
PRODUCT LAUNCH CAMPAIGNS (LIKE  CHILLVIBES) DRIVE BETTER ENGAGEMENT UPLIFT -->REPEAT THIS APPROACH. 
REDUCE SPEND ON PURE"AWARENESS"CAMPAIGNS(e.g., WRAPPED2024 ) UNLESS TIED WITH STRONG CTA. 

5. FOLLOWER RETENTION 
UNFOLLOWS  ARE ~35K(≈18%OF NEW  FOLLOWERS). 
IMPROVE RETENTION WITH PERSONALIZED PLAYLISTS , PUSH FOR RE -ENGAGEMENT CONTENT,AND COMMUNITY - DRIVEN POSTS.
