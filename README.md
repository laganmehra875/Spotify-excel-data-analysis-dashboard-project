## RECOMMENDATIONS :

1. FOCUS AD SPENDS. ON YOUTUBE 
HIGHEST ROI -->ALLOCATE A BIGGER SHARE OF THE NEXT CAMPAIGN 'S BUDGETS HERE.

---
2. OPTIMIZE INSTAGRAM STRATEGY
HIGH SPEND BUT LOWER ROI. 
RECOMMENDATION: SHIFT TOWARDS ORGANIC CONTENT( REELS, STORIES)+INFLUENCER TIE -UPS INSTEAD OF HEAVY ADS. 

---
3. DOUBLE DOWN ON PROVEN HASHTAGS 
CAMPAIGNS USING #DISCOVER WEEKLY AND #SPOTIFYWRAPPED PERFORM STRONGLY. 
KEEP THESE AS CORE HASHTAGS ACROSS PLATFORMS. 
---

4. CAMPAIGN STRATEGY
PRODUCT LAUNCH CAMPAIGNS (LIKE  CHILLVIBES) DRIVE BETTER ENGAGEMENT UPLIFT -->REPEAT THIS APPROACH. 
REDUCE SPEND ON PURE"AWARENESS"CAMPAIGNS(e.g., WRAPPED2024 ) UNLESS TIED WITH STRONG CTA. 
---

5. FOLLOWER RETENTION 
UNFOLLOWS  ARE ~35K(≈18%OF NEW  FOLLOWERS). 
IMPROVE RETENTION WITH PERSONALIZED PLAYLISTS , PUSH FOR RE -ENGAGEMENT CONTENT,AND COMMUNITY - DRIVEN POSTS.

## Conclusion :


This project successfully integrates Spotify’s social media data into a unified analytical framework that supports clearer, data-driven decision-making. Through systematic preprocessing, engagement evaluation, platform comparison, hashtag performance analysis, campaign effectiveness measurement, and follower-trend assessment, the insights point to several consistent patterns that can strengthen Spotify’s digital strategy.

The analysis shows that engagement is not evenly distributed across platforms or content types—visual and interactive formats tend to deliver stronger results, while certain hashtags and artist collaborations significantly boost reach. Platform performance comparisons highlight where Spotify receives the highest returns on engagement and follower growth, enabling more efficient allocation of advertising budgets. Campaign analysis further demonstrates how targeted initiatives influence impressions, clicks, and follower behaviour, helping distinguish high-ROI campaigns from those with lower impact. Additionally, follower-trend insights reveal the importance of sustained investment in content quality and platform consistency to support long-term audience loyalty.

Overall, the findings reinforce that a structured Social Media Intelligence System can greatly enhance Spotify’s ability to optimize content strategies, refine platform investments, and evaluate the success of ongoing campaigns. By applying these insights, Spotify can build a stronger digital presence, increase engagement efficiency, and ultimately support higher follower retention and conversion to premium subscriptions.
